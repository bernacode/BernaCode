# About BernaCode

We are a **Venezuelan startup** passionate about software engineering and digital product design. Founded with the vision of exporting world-class talent, we specialize in turning complex ideas into scalable systems.

## Our Mission

> "Democratizing access to high-quality software for companies looking to grow without limits."

We don't just write code; we build digital assets that generate real value. From academic management platforms to artificial intelligence engines.

## What makes us different?

*   **Business Focus**: We understand that software is a means to an end (profitability, efficiency).
*   **Quality over Quantity**: We prefer fewer satisfied clients with robust products than a portfolio full of failed projects.
*   **Radical Transparency**: You will know what technologies we use, how much it will cost, and when it will be ready.

### Technologies we love

*   **Backend**: Python, Django, FastAPI.
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla JS, Bootstrap (as you can see on this site 😉).
*   **Data**: PostgreSQL, Pandas, HubSpot.
