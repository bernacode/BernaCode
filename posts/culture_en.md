# Our Culture

At **BernaCode**, we believe that code is just the means, not the end. Our culture is based on solid engineering principles and radical transparency.

## Core Values

### 1. Quality over Speed
We prefer to say "no" to an impossible deadline than to deliver software with technical debt. We write clean, tested, and maintainable code.

### 2. Asynchronous Work
We respect "Deep Work". We minimize synchronous meetings and document everything excessively (like this blog) so that knowledge flows without interruptions.

### 3. Transparency
Our clients have direct access to the real status of their project. No black boxes.

> "We are not a software factory. We are digital artisans."
